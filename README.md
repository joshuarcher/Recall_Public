# Recall : Social Journaling
#### This repository is the project code for an iOS app that can be found [here][1]. I created this repo to give everyone the best idea of how I structure my Xcode projects.
#### Most frameworks I used were imported via Cocoapods, my favorite dependency manager.  Frameworks used for this project that cannot be seen:
* Digits by Twitter
* Answers by Twitter
* Realm
* Bond
* JSQMessages
* PureLayout
* Parse

I hope to update this repository weekly as I continue to add new features and refactor code. If you have any questions regarding this repo please don't hesitate to reach out via email!

Thanks for checking this out :)
